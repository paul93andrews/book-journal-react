# Book Journal Project

I've been working as a Front End Web Developer for about half a year at this point (May 2020). I love my job but I don't get to work in React everyday. I haven't had much time to practice my React skills further, nor learn Redux, React Hooks, Styled Components, Unit & Integration Testing more closely as a result. That is until now...

I decided to start this project in the late Winter and it combines all of the skills I wanted to improve upon and learn for the first time. I've enhanced my React skills by making an axios call to an API to display and save data to a database. The project uses Redux to manage state and React Hooks to make programming in React a more efficient experience. I've tested functions, actions, reducers, and components and styled them using Styled Components. In short, this is a very fun project that combines my love for reading with a growing skill set in React World.
